# JustType
A customizable, open-source typing test game with just the right amount of features.

## This project started out
as a fun way to practice eyeballing the design of a website and re-creating it myself. *cough* monkeytype *cough*.

## But eventually,
I worked for long enough that I just decided to recreate the entire website. Here we are!

### Made in completely *raw javascript, CSS, and HTML.*
### Designed entirely through eyeballing it. Never looked at CSS for inspiration!
### No typescript, Node.js, SASS, Pug, web development toolkit, nothing.
